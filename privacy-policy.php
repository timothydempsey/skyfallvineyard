      <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
      
      <div class="entry-content">

<p>We respect and are committed to protecting your privacy. The information you provide Skyfall Vineyard  and its wineries will not be shared or sold to other companies. The information is utilized so that we may offer a superior level of customer service reflective of the quality of our wines.</p>
<p><strong>SECURITY POLICY</strong></p>
<p>For your security, our web based ordering process utilizes the most up to date Secure Socket Layer technology. This software ensures that all sales transaction information is transferred safely via encrypted methods.</p>
<p><strong>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</strong></p>
<p>All wines are sold in their respective states, and title passes to buyer. We make no representation as to the legal right of anyone to ship or import wines into any state outside of Washington and Idaho. By placing an order with us, you authorize us to act on your behalf to engage a common carrier to deliver your order to you.</p>
<p><strong>SHIPPING POLICY</strong></p>
<p>Skyfall Vineyard  and its wineries comply with all federal, state and local laws regarding sale of alcohol. All shipments require an adult signature (21 years old or older with proper identification of age) for delivery. If an adult is not available to accept a wine shipment, additional attempts to deliver will be made. If these attempts are unsuccessful, your order will be returned to the distribution center it originated from. We strongly recommend delivery of wine shipments to a business, rather than a home address.</p>
<p>All orders are shipped via UPS. Most orders are shipped within 2-3 business days, excluding holidays and weekends. Weather conditions (heat or cold) may delay shipments until more favorable conditions exist. To protect wine from potential damage in winter and summer, we recommend 2nd day air. If you have concerns about weather conditions or wish to arrange for specific timing of your order, please contact the tasting room manager of your respective winery order or email <a href="mailto: info@SkyfallVineyard.com" target="_blank">info@SkyfallVineyard.com</a>.</p>
<p>Your credit card will be charged at the time of purchase to guarantee allocation of the wine. All sales are final. We are able to ship to specific states based on Ship Compliant guidelines.</p>
<p>We cannot ship alcohol to PO Boxes or APO/FPO addresses.</p>
<p>Many states now require the collection and remittance of sales and/or excise taxes. If your state is one of them, we will calculate these taxes for you and include them in the total amount charged to your credit card.</p>
<p><strong>REFUND/EXCHANGE POLICY</strong></p>
<p>Skyfall Vineyard  guarantees our wines. Your satisfaction is our priority. In the event of damage or defects with your order, please contact us within 3 days of receipt of your order for assistance. For fastest results, email us at <a href="mailto: info@SkyfallVineyard.com">info@SkyfallVineyard.com</a>.</p>
